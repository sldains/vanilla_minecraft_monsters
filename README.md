# Minecraft Monster Pack
A Collection of Vanilla Minecraft Monsters, a datapack for the Minecraft mod Origins.

My take on this pack was to make origins that both feel like the actual monsters in powers and promote playstyles similar to how those monsters fight. 
I tried to balance fun and interesting challenges with difficulty. 

The "no_phantoms_data" file is if you want to remove the original Origins Phantom.
